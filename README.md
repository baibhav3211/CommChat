# Commchat
*Comm chat is a react app, where admin and participants can chat and share  photos.*

1. In our app, the admin/host can create his/her virtual room and invite other participants. 
2. Admin can make their ID and give them to join. By this feature, the admin has full control of his virtual room. Any random person can’t enter in his room, because he does not      have any credential for entry.  
3. Admin can make different virtual rooms, can name them and introduce any participant in any room. 
4. Participants can text in their rooms and share photos. Participants can’t jump into other rooms without permission of the admin. 
5. In a room, the maximum limit of participants can join is 5.
